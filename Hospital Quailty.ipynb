Given that I work at a hospital, I'm well aware that I'll probably spend more time in hospitals later on in life than I do now. So I'll probably want to live near the best hospitals. If hospital quality were the only deciding factor, which state should I plan to retire in?\n\n**Methodology:**\n----------------\n\nExplore the data. Plot the data. Make decisions based on the data. Save up enough money to retire, and remember to check on these hospitals in about 30 years because the results might have changed by then. \n\nI'll comment out my code as much as possible, as reading others' comments has helped me tremendously. Lets begin by importing the data & loading all the libraries we'll use.\n\n**Insert Hospital Info File as R Dataframe Below**",
